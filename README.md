# haxe-poker-eval
 A haxe port of the as3 poker hand evaluator writen by SÃ¸ren Houen, based on cactuskev's poker evaluator https://github.com/houen/PokerFace.
 
 I've done some refactoring to help with using it in a Texas hold ems game, making it so that you can change the number of cards in a hand and get the cards that were used in the strongest hand.
 
 I've also added an implementation of the Chen formula for 2 cards and a small demo in openfl.
 
 At some point I plan to put in something to get a winning probability based on the players cards and community cards and some kind of performance test.
 
 The demo uses assets created by Kenny http://kenney.nl/
